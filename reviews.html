                           Best hosts ever <br> We were a group of 7. The hosts were extremely hospitable in getting us
                           settled right away. They helped with setting up the fire pit and ensured there was enough
                           wood for the night. They had all the required insect repellent sprays and got us covered with
                           a picnic table and a tarp for the tent. We could do some amazing stargazing.

                        <p>Perfect laid back camping experience! This was my first Hipcamp experience and it set the bar
                           high! Dot was so welcoming and you can tell she genuinely cares about her guests experiences.
                           Awesome, easy to find location while still being tucked away enough to enjoy to quiet
                           serenity of the hill country. Perfect trees for hammock camping (which is what I chose) but
                           also lots of areas that would make great tent spots. I will be back.

                        <p>Very pleasant surprise to find it! <br>The property host was very friendly and informative,
                           she met me on the drive into the camping area and provided camp chairs, table and a fire pit
                           starter kit. Very organized and thoughtful, the sites are natural, unimproved and provides
                           level areas to set up a tent, or park an RV. The property is very scenic with large oak trees
                           and grass, extremely quiet and secluded. except for the sounds of the wildlife. The property
                           has a powered gate at the entrance which provides a nice feeling of security.
                           A dedicated bathroom building with a flush toilet and solar shower is also provided.
                           I will definitely be returning!

                        <p>Serene! <br> Tbh I picked this place last minute and the host, Dorothy was kind enough to
                           accept my reservation. It was my partner and me who stayed and we loved the serenity of the
                           place. It's one of those hidden country side places which are tucked away in nature waiting
                           to be discovered. There was a flush and compost toilet onsite as well as a sink to wash your
                           face. We were amazed by the sustainable factors (water treatment systems, gardens) and how
                           clean the area was. Communication to the site was very precise and Dorothy took care we
                           didn't get lost. The night sky was so beautiful, we could stay up all night just star gazing.
                           I would definitely recommend this place as it is also centrally located to most of the
                           tourist attractions in the Hill Country area and plan to visit soon.

                        <p>"A getaway still close enough" <br>We had a lovely time in the Pasture! We came to Canyon Lake on a maiden voyage with our brand new 43.5 ft 5th wheel RV, but the RV Park we had booked on the lake had no lake access and trailers packed in like sardines with no space to even set up a sun shade in the middle of Texas summer! I hopped on HipCamp, found Dot's place 15 min from the lake and booked it. She messaged me within minutes with good directions. The pasture was peaceful and spacious. We were able to spread out, lounge around, walk through the woods, ride bikes, and even play ball in the field. Dot really has a great setup and is so accommodating. There was one small issue when the water well tank ran low, but I just called her up and she had it resolved in no time. My family and I really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend as a place to get away from the overcrowding of Canyon Lake camping options.

                           We stayed over Memorial Day weekend and love this place! 15 minute drive to Canyon Lake,
                           grocery store, public boat launch. Electric, water and sewage hookups were great. We loved
                           having dinner with the cows, the goat, and the hummingbirds. Great place to get away and
                           enjoy nature. Dot was such a wonderful host. She was so attentive, welcoming, and very
                           communicative with us. We would definitely stay here again.

It was so great sitting around the fire in the hill country with dot and stars above!

                        <p>Great hospitality and quiet, peaceful location. Good space in between RVs. The hookups were on the opposite side of our RV, so it made it harder to run sewage because our line isnâ€™t very long. Easy to find location. Address on Google Maps took us right there. 15 min from Gruene and about 30 min from the public park at Canyon Lake. Great location! Would absolutely stay there again! Hosts also made a camp fire on Saturday night which we didnâ€™t join because we were so tired after dinner, but a very friendly and hospitable gesture.
